# BabylonJS + CoffeeScript + Browserify + LiveReload Toybox

Learning-by-doing in BabylonJS. Expect very poor code, I'm just trying things and seeing what they do, uploading my progress when I want to show friends.

## Installation

To start using Phaser with CoffeeScript easily,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/selenologist/babylonjs-toybox
cd babylonjs-toybox
npm start
```
